 ## Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that Classic and Chicken pizzas, especially in large sizes, are the main revenue drivers, with the Classic Deluxe being the top-selling item. Sales peak on weekends and during afternoon to early evening hours, making these the most effective times for promotions. However, some pizzas like the Brie Carre Pizza consistently underperform and may require reevaluation. To maximize revenue and efficiency, focus on best-selling products, optimize marketing during peak periods, and consider phasing out or reinventing low performers.
